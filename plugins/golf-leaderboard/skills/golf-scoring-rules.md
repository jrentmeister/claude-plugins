# Golf Scoring Systems

## Stroke Play
The most common format where the total number of strokes determines the winner.

- Count every stroke taken on each hole
- Lowest total score wins
- Par is the standard number of strokes for a hole
- Scoring terminology:
  - Albatross/Double Eagle: -3 (3 under par)
  - Eagle: -2 (2 under par)
  - Birdie: -1 (1 under par)
  - Par: 0 (even with par)
  - Bogey: +1 (1 over par)
  - Double Bogey: +2 (2 over par)

## Match Play
Head-to-head competition where each hole is a separate contest.

- Win a hole by taking fewer strokes
- Winner of most holes wins the match
- Score shown as "holes up" (e.g., "2 up" or "3 & 2")
- Match ends when one player is up by more holes than remain

## Stableford
Point-based system that rewards aggressive play.

Standard Stableford points:
- Double Bogey or worse: 0 points
- Bogey: 1 point
- Par: 2 points
- Birdie: 3 points
- Eagle: 4 points
- Albatross: 5 points

Higher total points wins.

## Modified Stableford
Variation with different point values, often used in professional tournaments.

Example (PGA Tour):
- Double Bogey or worse: -3 points
- Bogey: -1 point
- Par: 0 points
- Birdie: +2 points
- Eagle: +5 points
- Albatross: +8 points

## Tournament Formats

### Individual Stroke Play
- Each player plays their own ball
- Total strokes determine final standing

### Team Formats
- **Scramble**: All players hit, team plays best shot
- **Best Ball**: Each player plays own ball, best score counts
- **Alternate Shot**: Partners alternate hitting the same ball
- **Four-Ball**: Two teams of two, best individual score per hole

## Handicap System
Allows players of different skill levels to compete fairly.

- Handicap Index: Measure of potential playing ability
- Course Handicap: Adjusted for specific course difficulty
- Net Score: Gross score minus handicap strokes
- Stroke allocation: Receive strokes on hardest holes based on handicap

## Cut Line
In multi-day tournaments, players must score well enough to "make the cut" and continue playing.

- Typically top 60-70 players and ties
- Usually after 36 holes (2 rounds)
- Ensures competitive field for final rounds

## Tie-Breaking
When players finish with the same score:

1. **Playoff**: Sudden death or predetermined holes
2. **Scorecard comparison**: Compare back 9, back 6, back 3, etc.
3. **Head-to-head**: Result of match between tied players
4. **Count-back**: Most birdies or best score on hardest holes
